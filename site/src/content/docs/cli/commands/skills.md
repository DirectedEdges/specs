Install the AI orchestration skills that ship with the CLI. The skills sequence the [versioning](/versioning/) workflows — run the commands in order, stop at the human review gates — and never generate report or changelog content themselves; the [`version`](/cli/commands/version/) commands produce all content.

## Usage

```bash
specs skills install [--dir <path>]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dir <path>` | Skill directory to emit into (default: `.claude/skills`) |

Two skills are emitted:

| Skill | Orchestrates |
|-------|--------------|
| `specs-cli.premerge` | [`specs version figmapremerge`](/cli/commands/version/#specs-version-figmapremerge) fetches, generates, and reports → human reviews the report → merge proceeds or not |
| `specs-cli.release` | [`specs version report`](/cli/commands/version/#specs-version-report) → human review → [`specs version cut`](/cli/commands/version/#specs-version-cut) → [`specs version tag`](/cli/commands/version/#specs-version-tag) → publish |
| `specs-cli.roles.propose` | [`specs analyze`](/cli/commands/analyze/) → read the live components over the bridge → write `analysis/roles.proposed.md` → human marks up the Decision column |
| `specs-cli.roles.apply` | Parse the approved decisions → annotate the Figma file one page at a time → human confirms in Dev Mode → [`fetch`](/cli/commands/fetch/), [`generate`](/cli/commands/generate/), [`analyze roles`](/cli/analyze/roles/) to prove the round trip |
| [`specs-cli.states.setup`](/cli/skills/states-setup/) | [`specs analyze props`](/cli/analyze/props/) → sort every variant prop into a state concept, a visibility toggle or a presentation flag → human clears the rows they disagree with → paste the [`states`](/settings/states/) block and [`specs react`](/cli/commands/react/) to prove the selectors emit |

`roles.propose` and `states.setup` are the two skills here that **author** a report rather than only sequencing commands, and for the same reason: the data does not contain the answer.

Which [role](/roles/) an element takes is a judgment — the discriminator between `checkbox`, `switch` and `togglebutton` is what the control does when operated, which no prop records. A rule reading `checked` and `indeterminate` would be right about `checkbox` and wrong about `toggle`, `switch` and `togglegroup`. Whether a boolean variant prop is a [state](/settings/states/) is the same shape of question: `filled`, `segmented`, `showChevron` and `highlighted` are indistinguishable by name, type or frequency, and one of them is a state.

So both reports carry the evidence behind each row and a human gate — before anything reaches a Figma file for `roles`, before anything reaches your config for `states`.

The emitted files are **canonical and overwritten on every install** — re-running after a CLI upgrade refreshes them to match the commands they orchestrate. Keep local customization in your own separate skills rather than editing the emitted ones.
