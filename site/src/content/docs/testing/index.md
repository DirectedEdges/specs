The code your workspace emits renders somewhere — and the only way to know it renders *right* is to look. Visual testing automates the looking: it screenshots every component variant in your Storybook and pixel-diffs each one against a baseline, so a regeneration tells you what changed instead of making you scroll and squint.

It answers two different questions, against two different baselines:

| Question | Baseline | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Does the code match the design?** | A Figma export of the same variant | Fidelity |
| **Did this regeneration change anything?** | The renders you last accepted | Regression |

Fidelity is the deeper check — it measures your generated code against the design itself, variant by variant. Regression is the cheap everyday one: no Figma access, no token, just "is today's output identical to yesterday's?" — and because emitted output is deterministic, *identical* means zero pixels, not "close".

One command drives both: [`specs testing visual`](/cli/commands/testing/). [Getting Started](/testing/getting-started/) walks the first run.

## How it works

Five stages, each its own subcommand because each has a different cost — re-scoring after a tolerance change takes seconds and must never cost a browser run:

| Stage | What it does | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest` | Finds each spec's node in your fetched Figma data, enumerates its variants, and works out which Storybook story renders each one | seconds |
| `baseline` | Downloads a Figma image of every variant — **only when you run it**, never automatically | minutes, uses your Figma API quota |
| `shoot` | Screenshots each variant's story in your running Storybook | minutes |
| `diff` | Compares each baseline/render pair, scores pass or fail, writes the report | seconds |
| `accept` | Promotes renders you've reviewed into the regression baseline | instant |

A pair passes when its dimensions match and its pixel difference is under the threshold. Dimension mismatches are reported separately from pixel noise — a render two pixels too wide fails even when its pixels look fine, because size errors and paint errors have different causes.

Components and compositions are both covered. A component yields one pair per variant; a composition — a full page or pattern — is a single frame and yields one pair. **Composition results are informational**: a page is built from components, so when a component is off, every page using it looks off too. Their rows carry full pixel counts but never fail a run — fix the components first.

## Where you see results

Each mode writes its own report, and your [workspace Storybook](/storybook/) publishes a page per report:

- **Testing → Fidelity to Figma**
- **Testing → Changes vs Accepted**

Sortable per-component results, ranked so dependency-graph leaves come first — fixing a leaf shrinks every diff downstream of it. Click a row and its worst failures expand as **baseline | render | diff** composites, the picture that diagnoses most failures in one glance. The pages read the report live: re-run `diff`, reload, done.

## What stays yours

Rendering engines never agree perfectly — Chrome and Figma rasterize the same text differently, and a design file has quirks no tool should silently absorb. `visual-ignore.yaml` is where your workspace records those judgments: a looser pass threshold for a component with font noise, a skipped variant whose baseline is a placeholder, a capped sample for a 700-variant matrix.

Every entry requires a `note:` saying why. These entries suppress real signal, and the note is what lets the next person tell a permanent measurement fact from a temporary allowance — an entry without one is indistinguishable from a bug someone hid.

## What it costs you

The CLI ships no browser and no image library. `specs testing visual init` writes a small `package.json` into `testing/visual/` declaring Playwright, pixelmatch and pngjs; you run one install there, the same way the [Storybook host](/storybook/) works. Everything except `shoot` runs with nothing installed.

Baseline capture is the one stage that spends something of yours — Figma API quota — which is why it never runs implicitly: not from the bare command, not from a watcher, not from [`specs build` or `specs run`](/cli/commands/build/). It runs when you type it, and it scopes itself: `status` compares a per-spec fingerprint of your fetched Figma data against what each baseline was captured from, so after a refetch, `baseline` recaptures the three designs that changed rather than the whole catalog.
