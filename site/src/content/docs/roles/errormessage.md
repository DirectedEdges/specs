title: "errormessage"
description: "Generate an id on the message element and aria-describedby on the control"
---

`errormessage` marks the element carrying a control's validation message. Without it the message is red text near an input: assistive technology announces the invalid state but never reads *why*.

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

The name comes from the ARIA *attribute* `aria-errormessage`. There is no ARIA role by this name, and the emitted wiring uses `aria-describedby`.

## Roles

Apply the following roles to elements:

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `errormessage` | Part | Element of `type: text` or `type: instance`, or nested instance prop of `type: string` |
| `description` | Part | Element of `type: text` or `type: instance`, or nested instance prop of `type: string` |

| Where | What is emitted |
|---|---|
| The message element | A generated `id` |
| The resolved control | `aria-describedby` referencing it, **only while the message renders** |
| An `instance` element carrying the role | Routing only — the wrapper's tag never changes |

`description` works identically for supplementary, non-error text.

## Specs

Component anatomy typically has elements and roles like:

```yaml
anatomy:
  field:
    type: container
    role: textbox
  errorText:
    type: text
    role: errormessage
```

## Figma

Annotate the following layers:

- the validation message layer as `role:errormessage`
- supplementary help text as `role:description`

Place it **beside** a collapsing control, not inside it — content inside a collapse does not render.

## React

### Implementation

```tsx
<TextInput label="Email" validation="invalid" errorText="Enter a valid email address." />
```

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div className="input" data-validation={p.validation} />
{p.validation === 'invalid' && (
  <div className="error-text">{p.errorText}</div>
)}

// after
<input className="input" aria-invalid={invalid}
  aria-describedby={invalid ? errorId : undefined} />
{invalid && (
  <div className="error-text" id={errorId}>{p.errorText}</div>
)}
```

### Contract

None. `errormessage` adds an `id` to its own element and an attribute to a different one. Validation state changes arrive through the control's own contract — the `invalid` concept bridged to `aria-invalid`.

## Web Components

Same emission **within one shadow root**. An id reference does not cross the boundary, so a message rendered by a different component cannot describe this control by id — the composed case recovers accessible text through [`partText()`](/roles/#parts-across-a-composed-component) instead.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Emits | The message folded into the field's accessibility output |
| Announced | The error is read together with the field |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Emits | `Modifier.semantics { error(message) }` on the field |
| Announced | The error is read together with the field |

## Additional details

### Conditional by design

The message typically renders only while the [`invalid` state](/settings/states/) is active, so the association appears and disappears with it. `aria-describedby` omits ids for elements whose render condition is false in the current variant — an `aria-describedby` pointing at an absent id is worse than none.

The role adds linkage, never show/hide logic. Visibility stays with the render condition the analysis already produced.

**Roles never invent markup.** Where no element carries the part, the control's contract omits the message prop rather than shipping a dead one.

### Resolution

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Accepted by a value-bearing control or `group` | Resolves to the component's single value-bearing control, wherever either sits |
| Two elements claiming it for one control | **Error** naming both |
| No candidate control in the component | Valid — emits element and id, no wiring. Wiring arrives on composition |
