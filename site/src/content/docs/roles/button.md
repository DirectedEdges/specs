## About

`button` declares that an element performs an action when activated. Without it the element cannot be tabbed to, Enter and Space do nothing, the generated props carry no `onClick` for a consumer to attach to, and a disabled state renders as an `aria-disabled` attribute the element cannot enforce — so a greyed-out button still receives clicks.

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

### Roles

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `button` | Control | Element of `type: container` or `type: glyph` |
| `label` | Part | Element of `type: text` or nested instance prop of `type: string` |
| `description` | Part | Element of `type: text` or nested instance prop of `type: string` |
| `indicator` | Part | Element of `type: container` or `type: glyph` |

The role element becomes the button and its descendants render inside it.

| Landing on | Result |
|---|---|
| `container` | Becomes the button; descendants render inside |
| `glyph` | Re-hosted **inside** the button rather than becoming it — adds one level to the markup |

Descendants that would otherwise emit as `<div>` emit as `<span>`: a button may only contain phrasing content. Classes, `data-element` values, and layout are unchanged.

### States

| State | Effect | Classify in `states`? |
|---|---|---|
| `disabled` | Natively disabled — unfocusable and unclickable, enforced by the platform | Recommended |
| `hover` / `active` | Native, on the button itself | Recommended, if the library styles it |
| `focus` / `focus-visible` | Native focus indicator | **Optional — prefer the platform default** |

Platforms ship a focus indicator that already meets contrast requirements. Specifying one from Figma usually replaces a good default with a worse one.

Unclassified props still work — they emit as `data-*` attributes for styling.

### Accessible name

| Source | Result |
|---|---|
| Text the button already contains | Names it; no `label` part needed |
| `label` part | Names it |
| A prop nominated as the accessible-name source | Emitted as the platform's label — the icon-only case |
| Nothing resolves | **Warns.** A correctly-marked button that announces nothing is worse than the container it replaced |

### `onClick` is a stub, deliberately

A click on a button means whatever the consumer decides, and the design file cannot say what. The transform calls the prop and does nothing else.

This is where `button` differs from [togglebutton](/roles/togglebutton/), which owns a state the click changes and so gets real generated logic.

## Specs

```yaml
anatomy:
  root:
    type: container
    role: button
  label:
    type: text
    role: label
  icon:
    type: glyph
    role: indicator
```

## Figma

- `root` as `role:button` — on the component node
- `label` as `role:label` on a `text` element or through a nested instance
- decorative glyphs as `role:indicator`

An icon-only button needs a name it cannot get from content. Nominate the prop carrying it as the accessible-name source in `conventions/specs.yaml`, or the transform warns.

## React

### Authored as

```tsx
<Button onClick={() => save()}>Save</Button>
<IconButton icon="close" accessibilityLabel="Close" onClick={() => dismiss()} />
```

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div
  className="button"
  data-element="root"
  aria-disabled={p.disabled ? 'true' : undefined}
>
  {/* … */}
</div>

// after
<button
  type="button"
  className="button"
  data-element="root"
  disabled={p.disabled}
  onClick={p.onClick}
>
  {/* … */}
</button>
```

### Contract

| Prop | Type | Tier | Generated body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `onClick?` | `(e: MouseEvent) => void` | MUST | Calls the prop, nothing more |
| `type?` | `'button' \| 'submit' \| 'reset'` | MUST | — |
| `onFocus?` / `onBlur?` | `(e: FocusEvent) => void` | COULD | Forwarded to the element |

## Web Components

The custom element **is** the root, so a root `button` cannot become a `<button>` tag. A real `<button>` is emitted **inside** the shadow root, wrapping the root's content:

- The shadow root sets `delegatesFocus`, so the host stays one focusable box
- The inner button is `all: unset` and takes no box, so the host keeps the root's layout and appearance exactly as the stylesheet writes it
- It is exposed as `part="button"` for consumers who need to reach it

Host semantics — `role="button"` plus `tabindex` — were tried and rejected. An ARIA role buys the announcement and nothing else: Enter and Space activation, `:disabled` blocking events, `:focus-visible`, and form participation are all behavior only a native element supplies. The earlier version announced a button no keyboard user could operate.

A **non-root** button is an ordinary element in the template and carries the tag directly.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `Button` |
| Announced | "Button"; becomes a rotor stop |
| `disabled` | `.disabled(_:)` |
| Keyboard | Reachable via Full Keyboard Access |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `Button` with `Role.Button` |
| Announced | "Button"; double-tap activates |
| `disabled` | `enabled = false` |
| Focus | Joins the accessibility focus order |
