description: "Emit a real anchor with href, so navigation is announced, focusable, and copyable"
---

`link` declares that an element navigates to another location when activated. Without it the element cannot be tabbed to, Enter does nothing, and there is no `href` for a consumer to point anywhere.

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

An anchor rather than a button, and the distinction is not cosmetic: a link is announced as a link, opens in a new tab on modifier-click, appears in a screen reader's links list, and is dragged and copied as a URL. A button does none of that.

## Roles

Apply the following roles to elements:

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `link` | Control | Element of `type: container`, `type: text`, or `type: glyph` |
| `label` | Part | Element of `type: text` or nested instance prop of `type: string` |

A `glyph` carrying the role is re-hosted inside the anchor rather than becoming it, as with [`button`](/roles/button/).

### States

The `link` role is typically applied in conjunction with the following states:

| State | Effect | Classify? |
|---|---|---|
| `disabled` | **Drops `href`** and announces `aria-disabled` | Recommended |
| `current` | `aria-current="true"` | Recommended |
| `hover` / `active` | Native anchor states | Recommended, if the library styles it |
| `focus` / `focus-visible` | Native focus indicator | **Optional — prefer the platform default** |

Two decisions earlier emission made silently:

- **An anchor has no `disabled` property.** Dropping `href` is what actually removes it from the tab order; `aria-disabled` alone announces a state the element does not enforce. The `css` transformer's disabled selector special-cases anchors to match.
- **`current` emits the generic token**, `aria-current="true"`, matching the states table's canonical selector. An earlier emission wrote `aria-current="page"`, which no stylesheet selector matched.

## Specs

Component anatomy typically has elements and roles like:

```yaml
anatomy:
  root:
    type: container
    role: link
  text:
    type: text
```

## Figma

Annotate the following layers:

- `root` as `role:link` — on the component node, or on an inline `text` element
- `label` as `role:label` where the link's name is not its own text

The design file cannot say where a link goes, so `href` has no source in the spec. It is the one prop this role exists to create a home for.

## React

### Implementation

```tsx
<InlineLink href="/pricing">See pricing</InlineLink>
<InlineLink href="/settings" current>Settings</InlineLink>
```

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div className="inline-link" data-element="root">
  {p.text}
</div>

// after
<a
  className="inline-link"
  data-element="root"
  href={p.disabled ? undefined : p.href}
  aria-disabled={p.disabled ? true : undefined}
  aria-current={p.current ? 'true' : undefined}
  target={p.target}
  rel={p.rel}
  onClick={(e) => p.onClick?.(e)}
>
  {p.text}
</a>
```

### Contract

| Prop | Type | Tier | Generated body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `href?` | `string` | MUST | Destination. Absent renders a placeholder the browser cannot focus |
| `target?` | `string` | SHOULD | Passed through |
| `rel?` | `string` | SHOULD | Passed through |
| `onClick?` | `(e: MouseEvent) => void` | SHOULD | Stub — navigation is the browser's |

## Web Components

As [`button`](/roles/button/#web-components) — a real `<a>` inside the shadow root, `all: unset`, with `delegatesFocus` so the host stays one focusable box.

One asymmetry worth knowing: an `href` **is** resolved against the document, so `href="#section"` from inside a shadow root navigates to a light-DOM target normally. The reverse does not hold — an `id` inside a shadow root is not addressable as a fragment target from outside, so a link elsewhere on the page cannot point *into* this component.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `Link` |
| Announced | As a link; double-tap opens it |
| `disabled` | No native equivalent — degrades to plain text |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | Clickable text with link semantics |
| Announced | As a link; double-tap opens it |
| `disabled` | Clickable removed; text remains |

## Additional details

### Accessible name

| Source | Result |
|---|---|
| The link's own text | Names it |
| The `accessibility.label` convention's prop | Emitted as `aria-label` |
| Nothing resolves | **Warns** |
