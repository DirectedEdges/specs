## About

Three roles cover content that appears or changes after load and must be announced without moving focus: `status` for transient confirmations, `alert` for interruptions, and `progressbar` for determinate or indeterminate progress. A toast that fades in, a validation summary on submit, and a progress bar that fills are all silent to a screen reader user unless the region is declared live **before** the content changes.

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

There is no partial credit: a live region declared *after* its content arrives announces nothing. Because the declaration must be in the markup up front, this is exactly the kind of signal a spec can carry and a runtime cannot infer.

### Roles

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `alert` | Control | Element of `type: container` |
| `status` | Control | Element of `type: container` |
| `progressbar` | Control | Element of `type: container` |

All three are literal WAI-ARIA role tokens, so the emission is `role="<name>"` directly, and all three substitute in place — tag, classes, and children unchanged.

| Role | Web emission |
|---|---|
| `alert` | `role="alert"` |
| `status` | `role="status"` |
| `progressbar` | `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuemin` / `aria-valuemax` / `aria-valuenow` |

### Choosing alert or status

A declaration of interruption severity, and the designer's to make — nothing in the markup can derive one from the other.

| Role | Politeness | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `alert` | Assertive — interrupts whatever is being read | Errors, session expiry, destructive-action warnings |
| `status` | Polite — waits for a pause | Save confirmations, transient toasts, result counts |

Choosing `alert` for a routine confirmation makes an application hostile to screen reader users, because every toast cuts off the sentence in progress. Choosing `status` for a genuine error means the error may not be announced until the user stops interacting.

### Determinate and indeterminate progress

The split comes from the `value` convention in `conventions/specs.yaml`, never from a prop-name guess, and carries two members:

| Member | Names |
|---|---|
| `prop` | The prop carrying progress |
| `indeterminate` | A boolean prop forcing the indeterminate presentation regardless of value |

Two members are necessary because many libraries model an indeterminate loading bar with a boolean and no value prop at all. A value-only mechanism would discard the one signal such a component carries.

Resolution order:

1. An `indeterminate` binding that is true suppresses `aria-valuenow`
2. Otherwise a resolved `value` binding produces the determinate form
3. Otherwise the indeterminate form is emitted, with a warning

### An announcement region may contain a control

A toast with a dismiss affordance is the common case. That affordance is an instance carrying its own [`button`](/roles/button/) role in its own spec; the containing `status` is unaffected. This is the sanctioned form of two roles in one rendered tree — different elements, different specs.

### States

| State | Effect | Classify in `states`? |
|---|---|---|
| `busy` | `aria-busy` on `status` and `progressbar` | Recommended |

The role does not replace the classification: the Figma variant prop carrying `busy` still wants an entry in the [`states` convention](/settings/states/).

## Specs

```yaml
anatomy:
  root:
    type: container
    role: status
  dismiss:
    type: instance
    instanceOf: iconButton
```

## Figma

- `root` as `role:status` or `role:alert` — on the component node
- a loading or progress component's `root` as `role:progressbar`
- a dismiss affordance keeps its own `role:button` in **its own** component, not here

For `progressbar`, declare the value binding in `conventions/specs.yaml`. A progress bar with neither a value nor an indeterminate binding emits the indeterminate form and warns.

## React

### Authored as

```tsx
<Toast>Trip saved.</Toast>
<Alert>Your session has expired.</Alert>
<LoadingBar indeterminate />
```

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div className="toast" data-element="root">
  {/* … */}
</div>

// after
<div className="toast" data-element="root" role="status">
  {/* … */}
</div>
```

A progress bar with an indeterminate boolean and no value prop:

```tsx
<div
  className="loading-bar"
  data-element="root"
  role="progressbar"
  aria-valuemin={p.min ?? 0}
  aria-valuemax={p.max ?? 100}
  {/* aria-valuenow omitted — the indeterminate binding resolved true */}
/>
```

### Contract

| Prop | Type | Role | Generated body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `min?` | `number` (default `0`) | `progressbar` only | `aria-valuemin` |
| `max?` | `number` (default `100`) | `progressbar` only | `aria-valuemax` |

`alert` and `status` add no props. None of the three adds an event handler — an announcement region reports; it does not respond.

## Web Components

The role goes on the **host**, not on an element inside the shadow root. A live region must be in the document the assistive technology is observing, and while shadow content is observed, declaring the region on the host is what keeps it stable across re-renders of the inner tree.

One consequence: content that changes inside the shadow root announces correctly, but replacing the **whole** host element — rather than mutating its content — re-declares the region and may drop the announcement. Update content, do not swap the element.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| `alert` | `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isStaticText)` plus an announcement notification |
| `status` | An announcement notification |
| `progressbar` | `ProgressView`, determinate or indeterminate |
| Announced | The change is spoken without moving focus |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| `alert` | `liveRegion = LiveRegionMode.Assertive` |
| `status` | `liveRegion = LiveRegionMode.Polite` |
| `progressbar` | `LinearProgressIndicator` with `progressBarRangeInfo` |
| Announced | The change is spoken without moving focus |
