## About

`value` marks the text element standing in for a control's value in the design. A designed text input is a stack of styled layers — a value text node, a placeholder text node, decorations, wrappers — where a native control is one element with attributes. Collapse replaces the stack, driven by annotation rather than discovery: without `value` the transform would have to guess which text node is the value.

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

The name is specs-native. ARIA has no vocabulary for pieces of a component, so the part vocabulary supplies one.

### Roles

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `value` | Part | Element of `type: text` |
| `placeholder` | Part | Element of `type: text` |

| Where | What is emitted |
|---|---|
| The `value` element | **Consumed** — its text seeds the control's value; the element does not render |
| The `placeholder` element | **Consumed** into the control's `placeholder` attribute |
| The resolved control | Renders with that value; its own contract carries the change signal |

### What happens to everything else

Unannotated descendants of a collapsing control do not render — the author declared what mattered by annotating it.

| Descendant | Result |
|---|---|
| Bare wrapper | Dropped silently |
| Text, glyph, image, or composed instance | Dropped, named in a warning |
| A `slot` | Dropped, named in a warning |
| A non-part role | Dropped, named in a warning |

Chrome that should keep rendering — icons, affordance buttons — belongs **beside** the collapsing container, not inside it.

### Resolution

- Accepted only by value-bearing concepts (`textbox`, `password`, `searchbox`, `spinbutton`, `slider`, `textarea`), so it resolves to the component's single value-bearing control wherever either sits. No tree walk, no ambiguity.
- At most one element per part per control. Two elements claiming `value` is an error naming both.
- A `value` with no candidate control is valid and self-describing — it emits no wiring, which arrives on composition.

### Contract

None. `value` tells the control where its value lives; the control's own role carries the event surface. Its `onChange` fires on every keystroke for the text family, or on drag and arrow keys for `slider`.

The only parts carrying handlers sit beside `value` on a `spinbutton`: `increment` and `decrement` emit real buttons whose `onClick` calls `stepUp()` / `stepDown()` on the control. Both delegate rather than owning behavior.

## Specs

```yaml
anatomy:
  field:
    type: container
    role: textbox
  value:
    type: text
    role: value
  placeholder:
    type: text
    role: placeholder
```

## Figma

- the value text layer as `role:value`
- the placeholder text layer as `role:placeholder`

Land the control's role on the container holding **only** these layers. Anything else inside is dropped.

## React

### Authored as

Nothing. `value` is a declaration the component acts on for itself; consumers address the control's `value` prop.

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div className="input-field">
  <div className="input-value">{p.value}</div>
  <div className="input-placeholder">{p.placeholder}</div>
</div>

// after
<input
  className="input-field"
  value={value}
  placeholder={p.placeholder}
  onChange={handleChange}
/>
```

### Contract

None.

## Web Components

Identical consumption. One difference: on [`textarea`](/roles/textbox/) the value is element content rather than an attribute, so the emitted element takes a property binding and renders no `value=""` attribute when empty.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Emits | The text field's bound value |
| `placeholder` | The `TextField` prompt |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Emits | The text field state's value |
| `placeholder` | The `placeholder` slot |
