## About

`label` marks the element carrying a control's visible label text. Without it a label is a container with text: clicking it does nothing, and assistive technology has no way to connect the text to the control it names.

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

For a proxy-input control like [checkbox](/roles/checkbox/), keeping the label as its own element is what stops the accessible name from swallowing description and required-indicator text sharing a wrapper.

### Roles

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | Part | Element of `type: text`, `type: slot`, or `type: instance`, or nested instance prop of `type: string` |

| Where | What is emitted |
|---|---|
| The `label` element | A real `<label>` with `htmlFor` referencing the control's generated id |
| The resolved control | A generated `id` |
| On a [`group`](/roles/group/) | `<legend>` instead, rendered first — there is no control id to point at |
| On an `instance` | Routing only — the control's id is routed in; the wrapper's tag never changes |
| Inside a collapsing control | Lifted out, re-emitted as a sibling of the emitted control |

A component only emits the `<label>` element for text it owns. A consumer wrapping a label subcomponent routes its control id in and the subcomponent emits the element — two nested `<label>` tags are impossible by construction.

### Resolution

| Accepting control | How it resolves |
|---|---|
| Value-bearing (`textbox`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `switch`, `slider`, …) | To the component's single value-bearing control, wherever either sits |
| Non-value-bearing (`button`, `togglebutton`, `link`, `disclosure`) | By proximity; ambiguity is an error naming the part and every candidate |
| No candidate control | Valid — emits `<label>` and an id, no `htmlFor`. It *provides* the part; wiring arrives on composition |

### Contract

None. Clicking a `<label htmlFor>` focuses or activates its control because HTML supplies that behavior; the control's own role carries the event surface.

### Where it emits nothing

Against a control named by its own content — a [`button`](/roles/button/) whose text is inside it — a `<label>` would be invalid markup and redundant. The part still matters as a **declaration**: it is what tells `button` to skip emitting an `aria-label` over text that already names it.

## Specs

```yaml
anatomy:
  field:
    type: container
    role: textbox
  fieldLabel:
    type: text
    role: label
```

## Figma

- the label text layer as `role:label`
- on a composed label component, `role:label` on the instance — it routes rather than emits
- on a [`group`](/roles/group/), the heading layer or its `slot`

## React

### Authored as

```tsx
<TextInput label="Email address" />
```

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div className="field-label">{p.label}</div>
<div className="input" />

// after
<label className="field-label" htmlFor={inputId}>{p.label}</label>
<input className="input" id={inputId} />
```

### Contract

None.

## Web Components

Within one shadow root the emission is identical. Across components it is not: an `htmlFor` reference does not cross a shadow boundary, so a composed label cannot associate to the consumer's control by id.

Accessible **text** recovers through the generated [`partText()`](/roles/#parts-across-a-composed-component) convention. What does not recover is **activation** — clicking a composed label's text does not operate the control on this target.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Emits | `.accessibilityLabel`, or `LabeledContent` where the label is visible |
| Announced | The control is announced by this text |
| Activation | Structural — a `LabeledContent` row is one target |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Emits | `contentDescription`, merged into the control's semantics |
| Announced | The control is announced by this text |
| Activation | The label is included in the control's touch target when merged |
