title: "group"
description: "Declare that a set of controls is answered together, so it is announced as one thing and disabled as one thing"
---

`group` declares that an element gathers several related controls answered together — a set of radio buttons, a row of checkboxes, an address block. Without it each control announces its own label and nothing more, the heading that says what is being chosen is programmatically unconnected, and a `disabled` variant styles every control while disabling none.

## Roles

Apply the following roles to elements:

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `group` | Control | `root` of `type: container` |
| `label` | Part | Element of `type: text` or `type: slot`, or nested instance prop of `type: string` |
| `description` | Part | Element of `type: text` or `type: slot`, or nested instance prop of `type: string` |
| `errormessage` | Part | Element of `type: text` or `type: slot`, or nested instance prop of `type: string` |

`label` names the group itself rather than pointing at a control, and must render first. The heading is usually a `slot`, and `label` on a slot means *whatever is slotted here names this group* — the naming element wraps the slot rather than replacing anything inside it.

### States

The `group` role is typically applied in conjunction with the following states:

| State | Effect | Classify? |
|---|---|---|
| `disabled` | Disables every control inside, enforced by the platform | Recommended |
| `required` | Announced as required | Recommended |
| `invalid` | Announced as invalid | Recommended |

`disabled` is the one worth classifying: one declaration disables the whole set without the transform touching a child. There is no `readonly` — no platform has a group-level equivalent, so set it per control.

## Specs

Component anatomy typically has elements and roles like:

```yaml
anatomy:
  root:
    type: container
    role: group
  header:
    type: slot
    role: label
  children:
    type: slot
```

## Figma

Annotate the following layers:

- `root` as `role:group` — on the component node
- `label` as `role:label` on the heading `text` element, its `slot`, or a nested instance
- `description` / `errormessage` as their own parts, where the group owns them

Author the heading **first**, above the controls. The transform lifts it into naming position either way, but a lift means rendered order stops matching layer order, and positional CSS in that subtree breaks.

## React

### Implementation

```tsx
<FormGroup header={<Legend>Cabin class</Legend>} name="cabin-class">
  <Radio value="economy" label="Economy" />
  <Radio value="premium" label="Premium" />
</FormGroup>
```

Omitting `name` still yields exclusive radios — it just submits under a generated key.

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div className="form-group" data-element="root">
  <div className="form-group__header" data-element="header">{p.header}</div>
  <div className="form-group__children" data-element="children">{p.children}</div>
</div>

// after
const groupName = p.name ?? React.useId();

<RadioGroupContext.Provider value={{ name: groupName }}>
  <fieldset className="form-group" data-element="root" disabled={p.disabled}>
    <legend className="form-group__header" data-element="header">{p.header}</legend>
    <div className="form-group__children" data-element="children">{p.children}</div>
  </fieldset>
</RadioGroupContext.Provider>
```

- `<fieldset disabled>` disables every control inside, enforced by the browser
- `<legend>` is announced on focus entry, and HTML requires it to be the first child
- Context is the only way to reach slotted radios — children are opaque to the component rendering them

### Contract

| Prop | Type | Tier | Generated body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name?` | `string` | SHOULD | Overrides the generated group name |

No event handler. A group does not respond; the controls inside it do.

## Web Components

Same `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` in the shadow root. Two differences:

- **No context needed.** Slotted children are real descendants of the host, so each radio walks up on connect and reads the group's name. Re-resolves on reconnect.
- **The host carries `[disabled]`** alongside the inner fieldset, so the stylesheet — written against the host — can still address the state. That is [precedence rule 1](/roles/precedence/#1-a-role-and-a-states-classification-emitted-once), not an exception.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `Section` with a header, descendants' accessibility merged |
| Announced | Group name before the first control |
| `disabled` | `.disabled(_:)` on the section, propagates to content |
| Grouping | Structural — a `Picker` owns its options, so no shared name exists |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | Container with `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true)` |
| Announced | Content description from the `label` part, before the first control |
| `disabled` | **Set per control** — does not propagate from a container |
| Grouping | `selectableGroup()` on the container |

## Additional details

### Naming the controls inside it

Radios are exclusive only when grouped, and only the group knows the set exists — so the group generates a name and publishes it. Each [`radio`](/roles/radio/) prefers its own `name` prop if given one.

The name is **never derived from the label text**: it would change with copy edits and localization, collide when two groups share a label, and break deterministic output. A generated name guarantees exclusivity but is a meaningless submission key, so anything that submits wants the consumer to pass `name`.

### Accessible name

The name comes from the `label` part. Where no `label` resolves, the group still emits, and **warns** — an unnamed group is announced as a group with nothing said about what it groups.
