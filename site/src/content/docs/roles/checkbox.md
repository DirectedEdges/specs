## About

`checkbox` declares that an element is a binary (or indeterminate) selection control. Without it the control carries `aria-selected` — a listbox-option attribute — and an inert `aria-checked`. It cannot be focused, checked, submitted, or validated; the label is an unassociated sibling; the error message rendered only when invalid is announced to no one; and the `:checked`, `:disabled`, and `:indeterminate` selectors the `css` transformer emits match nothing.

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

### Roles

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `checkbox` | Control | Element of `type: container` or `type: glyph` |
| `label` | Part | Element of `type: text` or nested instance prop of `type: string` |
| `description` | Part | Element of `type: text` or nested instance prop of `type: string` |
| `errormessage` | Part | Element of `type: text` or `type: instance` |
| `indicator` | Part | Element of `type: container`, `type: glyph`, or `type: vector` |

| Element | Emitted as |
|---|---|
| Injected first sibling | Visually hidden `<input type="checkbox">` — carries the states and the contract |
| The role element | `<label htmlFor>` pointing at the input, keeping its class and `data-element`, `aria-hidden` |

The proxy's whole footprint activates the input through HTML's own label behavior, with no positioning CSS — `aria-hidden` silences announcement but not pointer events. The proxy carries only the drawn state, never the label text: the accessible name comes from a **second** `<label>` emitted by the element carrying the `label` part, and HTML permits multiple labels per control.

- A `label` part must not sit inside the proxy's subtree — labels do not nest, and resolution warns if one does
- A `glyph` carrying the role is re-hosted inside the proxy structure first
- The injection adds one sibling, so positional CSS (`:nth-child`, adjacent-sibling selectors) in that subtree needs review
- The stylesheet gives the proxy `cursor: pointer`

### States

| State | Effect | Classify in `states`? |
|---|---|---|
| `checked` | Native `checked`, flipped by the wired handler | Recommended |
| `indeterminate` | Native `.indeterminate` DOM property, set via a ref effect | Recommended |
| `disabled` | Natively disabled, enforced by the platform | Recommended |
| `required` | Native `required` | Recommended |
| `invalid` | `aria-invalid` on the input | Recommended |
| `hover` / `active` | Native, on the proxy input | Recommended, if the library styles it |
| `focus` / `focus-visible` | Platform ring, re-drawn on the proxy | **Optional — prefer the platform default** |

The platform draws its ring around the *focused* element, which is the hidden input with no visible box. The generated stylesheet re-draws it on the visible proxy:

```css
.checkbox__control-input:focus-visible + .checkbox__control {
  outline: auto;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

`outline-style: auto` asks for the platform's own ring rather than imitating it. The input is injected immediately before the proxy, so the adjacent-sibling selector holds by construction. Override the same selector for a custom indicator.

### Enum-valued state props

A checked fact is boolean, but libraries routinely carry it in a three-value enum (`unselected` / `selected` / `indeterminate`). The mapping is declared entirely by the [`states` classification](/settings/states/), and the rule applies to every wired role reading an enum prop, not just this one.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Naming the value | `selected: { prop: selected, value: Selected }`. Without a `value`, the concept's own name is the value — `checked: { prop: state }` means `state === "checked"` |
| Normalization | Enum values are lowercased in the emitted contract, and every generated comparison matches that spelling |
| Write-back | A boolean prop is assigned directly; an enum prop is written to the declared checked value on check and the remaining arm on uncheck |
| Tri-state | The flip only rewrites the checked/unchecked pair, so an `indeterminate` value set by the consumer survives until the user operates the control |

Nothing here is decided by the transform — which prop, and which value counts as checked, both come from the classification.

### Wired state

`onChange` follows [the wired state model](/roles/#the-wired-state-model): internal state seeded from the checked prop, flipped on activation, consumer callback after.

Prerequisite: a `checked` classification naming the prop. Without it the handler degrades to a stub and warns.

### Accessible name

From the `label` part, emitted as a real `<label>` associated by `htmlFor`. The click-target proxy is `aria-hidden` and contributes nothing.

## Specs

```yaml
anatomy:
  control:
    type: container
    role: checkbox
  checkGlyph:
    type: glyph
    role: indicator
  formLabel:
    type: instance
    instanceOf: formLabel
    role: [label]
  errorMessage:
    type: instance
    instanceOf: formErrorMessage
    role: [errormessage]
```

## Figma

- `control` as `role:checkbox` — on the layer drawing the box, and nothing beyond it
- the check mark as `role:indicator`
- `label` as `role:label` on a `text` element or through a nested instance
- the validation message as `role:errormessage`

The label must not sit inside the role element's subtree — the proxy becomes a `<label>`, and labels do not nest.

## React

### Authored as

```tsx
<Checkbox label="Send me trip updates" checked={on} onChange={(e) => setOn(e.target.checked)} />
```

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div className="checkbox" data-element="root"
  aria-disabled={p.disabled ? 'true' : undefined}
  aria-selected={p.selected ? 'true' : undefined}>
  <div className="checkbox__control" data-element="control">{/* … */}</div>
  {/* … unassociated label and error message … */}
</div>

// after
<div className="checkbox" data-element="root">
  <input id={controlId} type="checkbox"
    checked={selected === "selected"}
    onChange={(e) => { setSelected(e.target.checked ? "selected" : "unselected"); p.onChange?.(e); }}
    disabled={p.disabled} name={p.name} value={p.value} />
  <label className="checkbox__control" data-element="control" htmlFor={controlId} aria-hidden="true">{/* … */}</label>
  {/* … label routed htmlFor={controlId}; error message gains id + aria-describedby … */}
</div>
```

The proxy becoming a label is the single most important detail: without it the visual looks correct and does nothing on click.

### Contract

| Prop | Type | Tier | Generated body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `onChange?` | `(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void` | MUST | **Wired** — flips checked, then calls the prop |
| `onBlur?` | `(e: FocusEvent) => void` | SHOULD | Stub |
| `name?` | `string` | MUST | — form submission identity |
| `value?` | `string` | MUST | — submitted value |
| `checked` | `boolean` | — | The existing variant prop |

`name` and `value` are genuinely new API the spec does not declare.

## Web Components

Same proxy structure inside the shadow root. Shadow DOM hides the inner input from a containing form, so the host participates directly: it emits `static formAssociated = true`, attaches `ElementInternals`, and reports its value and validity through them. The sync runs from `willUpdate`, so both user interaction and consumer-driven prop changes reach the form.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `Toggle` |
| Announced | The label and checked value; double-tap flips it |
| `indeterminate` | No native equivalent — degrades to unchecked with a warning |
| `indicator` | Not consumed — the platform draws its own mark |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `Checkbox` with `Role.Checkbox` |
| Announced | "Checked" / "not checked"; double-tap toggles |
| `indeterminate` | `TriStateCheckbox` with `ToggleableState.Indeterminate` |
| `indicator` | Partly consumed — `CheckboxDefaults.colors` takes box and mark colors |
