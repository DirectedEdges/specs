title: "panel"
description: "Mark the region a disclosure controls, generating the id that aria-controls points at"
---

`panel` marks the region a [disclosure](/roles/disclosure/) trigger expands and collapses. `aria-expanded` tells assistive technology that something expands; it does not say *what*. Without the linkage a screen reader user hears that a control is expanded and must hunt for the content in reading order.

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

This is the only way to supply that half of the pattern, because ids are generated at render and cannot be authored.

## Roles

Apply the following roles to elements:

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `panel` | Part | Element of `type: container` or `type: slot` |

| Where | What is emitted |
|---|---|
| The panel element | A generated `id` |
| The `disclosure` trigger | `aria-controls={panelId}` |

The panel's tag, classes, and children are unchanged. The role adds linkage, never show/hide logic.

## Specs

Component anatomy typically has elements and roles like:

```yaml
anatomy:
  header:
    type: container
    role: disclosure
  panel:
    type: container
    role: panel
```

## Figma

Annotate the following layers:

- `panel` as `role:panel` — on the region the trigger controls

It does not need to be a descendant of the trigger.

## React

### Implementation

Nothing. `panel` is wiring the component emits for itself; a consumer never addresses it.

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div className="accordion-panel" data-element="panel">{p.children}</div>

// after
<div className="accordion-panel" data-element="panel" id={panelId}>{p.children}</div>
```

The panel's own diff is one attribute. The change that matters happens on the trigger, which gains `aria-controls={panelId}`.

### Contract

None. `panel` adds an `id` to its own element and an attribute to a different one. The expansion event belongs to the trigger, which owns `onExpandedChange`.

The only parts carrying handlers are `increment` and `decrement`.

## Web Components

Same emission. The id and the trigger's `aria-controls` must be in the **same shadow root** — an id reference does not cross the boundary, so a panel arriving as slotted content from another component cannot be linked.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | The disclosure's content |
| Linkage | Structural — no id reference exists or is needed |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | The `AnimatedVisibility` content of the toggleable header |
| Linkage | Structural |

## Additional details

### Resolution

`disclosure` is not value-bearing, so `panel` resolves by proximity:

1. The candidate disclosure whose subtree contains the panel, if there is one
2. Otherwise the candidate that is the panel's closest sibling-path ancestor's child

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Panel is a sibling of its trigger | Resolves — the usual shape, and what the proximity rule exists for |
| Two disclosures, ambiguous panel | **Error** naming the panel and every candidate |
| No `disclosure` in the component | Valid. Emits the id, no wiring — the component *provides* a panel, and wiring arrives on composition |
