## About

`switch` declares an on/off control whose change takes effect immediately — no submit, no confirm. Without it the control is a container drawing a track and a handle: it cannot be focused or flipped from the keyboard, and its condition reaches assistive technology as a `data-*` attribute if at all, so a screen reader announces the same thing whether it is on or off.

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

### Roles

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `switch` | Control | Element of `type: container` or `type: glyph` |
| `label` | Part | Element of `type: text` or nested instance prop of `type: string` |
| `description` | Part | Element of `type: text` or nested instance prop of `type: string` |
| `indicator` | Part | Element of `type: container`, `type: glyph`, or `type: vector` |

Emission is the proxy-input structure [checkbox](/roles/checkbox/) uses:

| Element | Emitted as |
|---|---|
| Injected first sibling | Visually hidden `<input type="checkbox" role="switch">` — carries state and contract |
| The role element | `<label htmlFor>` pointing at the input, keeping its class and `data-element`, `aria-hidden` |

The proxy's whole footprint activates the input through HTML's own label behavior, with no positioning CSS. Because the proxy is a `<label>`, a `label` part must not sit inside its subtree — labels do not nest, and resolution warns if one does.

`role="switch"` on a native checkbox input is the standard pattern: the input supplies keyboard operation, focus, and form participation, and the role changes only the announcement, from "checked" to "on".

A switch's track, handle, and state glyphs are all drawn state. Each carries [`indicator`](/roles/indicator/) and is hidden, so the state announces once, from the input.

### How it differs from its neighbors

| | `switch` | [`checkbox`](/roles/checkbox/) | [`togglebutton`](/roles/togglebutton/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Element | `<input role="switch">` | `<input type="checkbox">` | `<button>` |
| State attribute | `aria-checked`, announced "on"/"off" | Native checked, announced "checked" | `aria-pressed` |
| Immediacy | Applies at once | Usually submits with a form | Applies at once |
| Indeterminate | None — binary by definition | Native `.indeterminate` | None |

They do not collapse into one implementation: a togglebutton is a button that stays pressed; a switch and a checkbox are form controls whose announcements differ because their timing differs.

### States

The switch reads the `checked` classification, falling back to `selected` — libraries split this one fact across both vocabularies, and a switch's prop is routinely the same `selected` boolean its checkbox sibling uses. Precedence suppresses by prop, so whichever concept binds, the fact announces once.

| State | Effect | Classify in `states`? |
|---|---|---|
| `checked` / `selected` | Native checked, announced on/off via `role="switch"` | Recommended |
| `disabled` | Natively disabled | Recommended |
| `hover` / `active` | Native, on the proxy input | Recommended, if the library styles it |
| `focus` / `focus-visible` | Platform ring, re-drawn on the proxy | **Optional — prefer the platform default** |

No indeterminate arm — a switch is binary by definition.

The focus ring reaches the visible proxy through the adjacent-sibling selector the generated stylesheet emits:

```css
.switch__action-input:focus-visible + .switch__action { outline: auto; }
```

Override that selector to draw a custom indicator.

### Wired state

`onChange` follows [the wired state model](/roles/#the-wired-state-model): internal state seeded from the classified prop, flipped on activation, consumer callback after. Without a binding it degrades to a stub and warns.

### Accessible name

From the `label` part — owned or routed through a composed label component — emitted as a real `<label htmlFor>`. The click-target proxy is `aria-hidden` and contributes nothing to the name.

## Specs

```yaml
anatomy:
  action:
    type: container
    role: switch
  track:
    type: container
    role: indicator
  handle:
    type: container
    role: indicator
  formLabel:
    type: instance
    instanceOf: formLabel
    role: [label]
```

## Figma

- `action` as `role:switch` — on the layer drawing the track, and nothing beyond it
- `track`, `handle`, and any state glyph as `role:indicator`
- `label` as `role:label` on a `text` element or through a nested instance

The label must not sit inside the role element's subtree — the proxy becomes a `<label>`, and labels do not nest.

## React

### Authored as

```tsx
<Switch label="Email notifications" checked={on} onChange={(e) => setOn(e.target.checked)} />
```

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<div className="switch__action" data-element="action">
  <div className="switch__track" data-element="track" />
  <div className="switch__handle" data-element="handle" />
</div>

// after
<input className="switch__action-input" id={actionId} type="checkbox" role="switch"
  checked={checked}
  onChange={(e) => { setChecked(e.target.checked); p.onChange?.(e); }}
  disabled={p.disabled} name={p.name} value={p.value} />
<label className="switch__action" data-element="action" htmlFor={actionId} aria-hidden="true">
  <div className="switch__track" data-element="track" />
  <div className="switch__handle" data-element="handle" />
</label>
```

### Contract

| Prop | Type | Tier | Generated body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `onChange?` | `(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void` | MUST | **Wired** — flips the state, then calls the prop |
| `onBlur?` | `(e: FocusEvent) => void` | SHOULD | Stub |
| `name?` | `string` | MUST | — form submission identity |
| `value?` | `string` | MUST | — submitted value |

## Web Components

Same proxy structure inside the shadow root. Shadow DOM hides the inner input from a containing form, so the host participates directly through `formAssociated` and `ElementInternals`, reporting its value from `willUpdate` — see [checkbox](/roles/checkbox/#web-components).

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `Toggle` with `.toggleStyle(.switch)` |
| Announced | The label and on/off value; double-tap flips it |
| `indicator` | Not consumed — the platform draws its own track and thumb |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `Switch` with `Role.Switch` |
| Announced | "On" / "off"; double-tap flips it |
| `indicator` | Partly consumed — `SwitchDefaults.colors` takes track and thumb colors |
