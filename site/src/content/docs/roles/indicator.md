## About

`indicator` marks an element as a decorative representation of state — a check glyph inside a checkbox, the thumb of a switch, the chevron on a disclosure. It is the one part whose job is subtraction: a checkbox already announces "checked" through its control, and a glyph that also exposes itself announces the same fact twice, the second time as noise like "checkmark graphic."

**Status** — React: Implemented • Web Components: Implemented • iOS: Not yet planned • Android: Not yet planned

Without it the transform cannot distinguish a glyph that means something from one that merely draws the state, so it must hide all of them or none.

### Roles

| Role | Type | Element |
|---|---|---|
| `indicator` | Part | Element of `type: container`, `type: glyph`, or `type: vector` |

| Where | What is emitted |
|---|---|
| The indicator element | `aria-hidden="true"` |
| The resolved control | Nothing |

Tag, classes, layout, and styling are unchanged — only the attribute is added, so nothing visual changes.

**An `aria-hidden` element must not contain focusable content.** An indicator whose subtree holds a slot or an interactive element warns: hiding it would strand the focusable descendant where assistive technology cannot reach it.

### Resolution

| Accepting control | How it resolves |
|---|---|
| Value-bearing (`checkbox`, `radio`, `switch`) | To the component's single value-bearing control, regardless of tree position |
| Non-value-bearing (`button`, `togglebutton`, `disclosure`) | By proximity; ambiguity is an error naming every candidate |

Resolution rarely matters here, because the emission does not depend on which control it resolved to. It matters only for validating that the part is accepted at all.

### Contract

None. An indicator is decoration by declaration. An element that needs a handler is not an indicator — it is a [button](/roles/button/) or an `increment` / `decrement` part.

### Where it is consumed instead

[`radio`](/roles/radio/) is the exception: it styles its control directly rather than proxying, so a `container`-typed indicator is consumed into styling rather than emitted with `aria-hidden`. A `glyph`-typed indicator cannot be consumed there and warns.

## Specs

```yaml
anatomy:
  checkGlyph:
    type: glyph
    role: indicator
```

## Figma

- the state glyph as `role:indicator` — the check mark, switch thumb, chevron, or radio dot

Annotate every drawn state layer, not just the obvious one. A switch's track, handle, and state glyphs are all drawn state and all want the part.

## React

### Authored as

Nothing. `indicator` is a declaration the component acts on for itself.

### Before / After

```tsx
// before
<span className="check" data-element="checkGlyph" />

// after
<span className="check" data-element="checkGlyph" aria-hidden="true" />
```

### Contract

None.

## Web Components

Identical — `aria-hidden="true"` on the element inside the shadow root. No host involvement, because the attribute describes the glyph, not the component.

## iOS

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Emits | `.accessibilityHidden(true)` |
| Result | VoiceOver skips the glyph; the state announces once, from the control |

## Android

Not yet planned. Intended binding:

| | |
|---|---|
| Emits | `clearAndSetSemantics {}` |
| Result | TalkBack skips the glyph; the state announces once, from the control |
