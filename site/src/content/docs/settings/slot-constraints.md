description: "Consolidate slot constraints from code-only props into the slot property"
---

Consolidate slot constraints (`anyOf`, `minChildren`, `maxChildren`) into the slot property. A library fact, declared in `config/conventions.yaml`: it states that the library authors slot constraints as code-only props — a library that does, but leaves this off, loses declared constraint data. Constraints are read from two sources — Figma's native `slotSettings` API (when the slot has native settings configured) and code-only props (the legacy naming convention). Both sources produce the same output fields.

See the [Slot Constraints](/guides/slot-constraints/) guide as well as the [Figma Slots for Repeating Items](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/figma-slots-for-repeating-items) blog post for how constraint consolidation works.
:::

## Configuration

```yaml
figma:
  slotConstraints: true
```

## Result

**Without** consolidation (`false`) the constraints remain standalone string props alongside the slot:

```json
{
  "props": {
    "children": { "type": "slot" },
    "childrenAnyof": { "type": "string", "examples": ["DS Button"] },
    "childrenMaxchildren": { "type": "string", "examples": ["2"] },
    "childrenMinchildren": { "type": "string", "examples": ["1"] }
  }
}
```

**With** consolidation (`true`) they collapse into the `children` slot as `anyOf`/`minChildren`/`maxChildren`, and the standalone props are removed:

```json
{
  "props": {
    "children": {
      "type": "slot",
      "anyOf": ["DS Button"],
      "minChildren": 1,
      "maxChildren": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## Options

- **Type**: boolean
- **Default**: `false`
- **Effect**: When `true`, slot constraint metadata is merged into the corresponding slot property — sourced from Figma native `slotSettings` first, falling back to code-only props. When `false`, slot constraints are not consolidated.

## Path

`figma.slotConstraints` in `config/conventions.yaml`
