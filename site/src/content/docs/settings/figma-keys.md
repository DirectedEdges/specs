title: "naming"
description: "Declare the naming convention your Figma file uses, so formatted keys stay reversible"
---

The naming convention your Figma file uses for layer names and component property names.

Where [`keys`](/settings/keys/) controls what the spec *emits*, `naming` describes what the Figma file *contains*. That is why the two live in different files: `keys` is a run choice in `config/settings.yaml`, while `naming` is a fact about the library, declared in `config/conventions.yaml` — a wrong declaration makes name reversal undefined, not merely different. Declaring it gives every formatted key a defined name to reverse back into when a spec is rendered into Figma.

## Options

- **Default**: `NONE`
- **Values**:
  - `NONE` - No convention declared. Names are not checked, and nothing is preserved
  - `SENTENCE` - First word capitalized, rest lowercase (`Icon leading`)
  - `TITLE` - Every word capitalized (`Icon Leading`)

Only the two conventions observed in real Figma files are accepted as declarations. This is deliberately narrower than `keys`.

**Legacy name**: in the pre-split `specs.config.yaml`, this option was `config.format.figmaKeys`. The legacy file still loads, migrating that member to `figma.naming` in memory.

## Path

`figma.naming` in `config/conventions.yaml`

### Example

```yaml
# config/conventions.yaml
figma:
  naming: TITLE   # Figma layer names are Title Case
```

```yaml
# config/settings.yaml
spec:
  keys: CAMEL     # spec emits camelCase
```

## Opting in

`NONE` is the default, and it means your specs behave exactly as they always have: names are formatted per [`keys`](/settings/keys/), nothing is checked, and no Figma names are preserved.

Declaring `SENTENCE` or `TITLE` turns on three things at once:

- Every layer and property name is checked against the safe key grammar.
- Any name that cannot survive formatting has its Figma name recorded in `$extensions.com.figma.name`.
- Rendering a spec back into Figma has a defined name to reverse into.

This is a trade, not a free upgrade. You gain round-trip fidelity and pay for it in spec size — every name outside the grammar grows an extension block. On a file with inconsistent layer naming, that can be a lot of new output. Declare a convention when you intend to render specs back into Figma, or when you want the divergences surfaced.

## Why the declaration matters

Declaring the convention your file actually uses keeps specs quiet. A file authored in Title Case but read as sentence case treats every name as divergent, so each anatomy element and prop carries a preserved copy of its Figma name — noise that buries the names genuinely worth fixing.

Names that fall outside the declared convention, or outside the safe character set, are still fully supported. Their Figma name is recorded in `$extensions.com.figma.name` on the definition.

Names already written as keys are handled too. If your file is mostly sentence case but a few properties are named `isDisabled` for the engineers reading them, those are kept exactly as authored — provided they match the convention you emit — and never rewritten to `Is disabled` when the spec is rendered back.
