/**
 * Default Conventions
 *
 * A workspace that declares nothing.
 *
 * This constant carries no members, because a platform-keyed map has no fixed key to
 * populate. That does **not** mean the defaults are gone: `naming`, `slotConstraints`
 * and `inferNumberProps` are still defaulted, by whoever resolves a platform, and
 * {@link ResolvedPlatformConventions} requires them for exactly that reason.
 *
 * What no default can supply is a convention *block* — `glyphs`, `subcomponents`,
 * `images`. Their absence is a statement about the library, and inventing one would
 * fabricate a fact nobody declared.
