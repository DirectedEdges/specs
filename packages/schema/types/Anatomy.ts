/**
 * Semantic behavior role for an anatomy element (ADR-066).
 *
 * An open string. The recognized vocabulary is documented here and grown by
 * vocabulary ADRs without a schema bump; transforms ignore unrecognized values,
 * so an unknown role is inert and emission falls through to current behavior.
 *
 * Roles are populated by `specs generate` from a Figma Dev Mode annotation on the
 * component node or one of its layers, of the form `role:<concept>` in the
 * annotation's label. `api.yaml` itself is never hand-edited, and there is no
 * authored surface to merge.
 *
 * Two kinds of concept, distinguished by how they resolve rather than how they
 * are spelled:
 *
 * **Control roles** name a control, landmark, or announcement region and resolve
 * on their own:
 * - Form controls (ADR-067): `textbox`, `password`, `searchbox`, `spinbutton`,
 *   `slider`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `textarea`, `switch`, `group`
 * - Interactive roots (ADR-068): `button`, `togglebutton`, `link`, `disclosure`
 * - Announcements (ADR-068): `alert`, `status`, `progressbar`
 *
 * **Part roles** name a constituent of some control and resolve against that
 * control: `value`, `placeholder`, `label`, `description`, `errormessage`,
 * `legend`, `panel`, `indicator`, `increment`, `decrement`. Each control concept
 * declares which parts it accepts.
 *
 * Naming scheme: single flat lowercase alphanumeric tokens — no hyphens,
 * underscores, dots, or internal casing. Part names are bare and scoped by their
 * control (`placeholder`, never `inputPlaceholder`). Tokens name interaction
 * semantics, not web markup, so each platform transform binds a concept to its
 * own idiom.
