// Strokes, as borders or outlines (specs#691).
//
// strokes + strokeWeight together form a border. `border-style` must be emitted
// whenever strokes is present and non-null — CSS borders are invisible without it.
//
// strokeAlign mapping — every alignment is an outline:
//   INSIDE  → outline pulled in by its own width (outline-offset: -W)
//   CENTER  → outline (renders centered on the element edge)
//   OUTSIDE → outline (renders outside element bounds)
//   null    → remove border (border-width: 0; border-color: transparent)
//
// A Figma stroke costs no space at any alignment: the frame stays the size it
// was and the stroke is drawn relative to its edge. A CSS border cannot do
// that — it is only "inside" when the element has an explicit size, and
// `box-sizing: border-box` does nothing for a hugging element, where the
// border adds its width to the box and pushes the content in. A badge hugging
// its content came out 2px taller than the design for exactly that reason.
//
// An outline affects no layout and follows border-radius, so a negative
// offset of its own width lands an inside stroke where Figma draws it. The
// one thing an outline cannot express is a per-side weight, which keeps the
// border mapping — the design strokes some sides and not others, and four
// widths need four properties.
