# Propose roles

Produce `analysis/roles.proposed.md`: a per-component table proposing a
[role](https://www.specsplugin.com/roles/) for each unannotated anatomy element,
with the evidence behind it and a **Decision** column a system designer edits in
place.

This skill **authors its report**, unlike the others here. Which role an element
takes is a judgment — the discriminator between `checkbox`, `switch` and
`togglebutton` is what the control does when operated, which no prop records.
A rule that read `checked` + `indeterminate` and emitted `checkbox` would be
right about `checkbox` and wrong about `toggle`, `switch` and
`togglegroup`. Everything below exists to keep that judgment reviewable.

Nothing is written to Figma. The sweep is `specs-cli.roles.apply`, and it runs
only after a human has marked this file up.

## Steps

1. **Check the preflight.**

   ```bash
   specs bridge status
   ```

   One plugin must be connected — **and you must check which file it is connected
   to.** The status line prints the connected file's key and name:

   ```
   Bridge running (pid 36652). 1 plugin connected:
     043ln8eiOoivUN5FicuGCF (ADS Components) — connected
   ```

   That key has to match the `key` of a source in `config/settings.yaml` under
   `data.sources`. **If it does not match, stop and say so.** Do not read or write
   anything through the bridge.

   "Connected" on its own is not the gate, and treating it as the gate is how a
   sweep ends up in the wrong Figma file. A bridge left running from earlier work
   answers exactly like the right one, every request succeeds, the report says
   `applied`, and the write lands in a file nobody was looking at. Nothing
   downstream detects it, because the file you meant to annotate is unchanged and
   still looks like it simply has no roles yet.
   `settings.spec.roles` must be `true`, or generated specs carry no roles
   and the before-measure is meaningless rather than zero.

2. **Produce the inputs.**

   ```bash
   specs analyze
   ```

   `analysis/roles.yaml` is the before-measure and the list of bare elements
   with their types. `analysis/props.yaml` is the cross-library prop inventory.
   `analysis/dependencies.byComponent.yaml` says which elements are instances of
   other components.

3. **Read what is already annotated, first.** In `analysis/roles.yaml`, any
   component with a `roles` entry was annotated by hand, and it is the library's
   own convention. It calibrates everything else — one hand-annotated field
   component settles how every other field in the library should read. Check it
   for gaps too: a partial annotation is a likely oversight, and proposing the
   missing part is one of the most valuable rows in the report.

4. **Read the live components.** `POST /inspect` per component, with
   `pageId` and `nodeId` from each spec's `metadata.source`, and
   `conventions` / `settings` taken from `specs/latest.metadata.yaml` —
   that file records the resolved pair, so do not reconstruct it. The response
   gives, per anatomy key: the Figma layer name behind it, the element type, which
   variants carry it, and any annotations already standing on it.

   The Figma layer name is the part a spec cannot supply under
   `figma.naming: NONE`, and it is often the strongest evidence in the report —
   a layer named `Field.Label` says what `fieldLabel` only hints at.

   Variant coverage matters for the same reason: a spec's `detectedIn` names a
   single variant that witnesses the element, not the set it appears in.

5. **Read the vocabulary, in this order.**
   [Choosing a role](https://www.specsplugin.com/roles/choosing/) first — it is
   the differentials, which is where most of the judgment comes from. Then the
   per-role pages for the mechanics of each candidate, which also state **which
   parts each control accepts and on which element types**; a part proposed onto a
   type its control does not accept will not resolve. Then
   [precedence](https://www.specsplugin.com/roles/precedence/).

6. **Check each control against the parts it accepts.** Do this before writing any
   proposal, because it is the only pass that can see what is *absent* — an
   element-by-element walk only ever looks at elements that exist, so a part the
   design never drew is invisible to it.

   Each control role's page carries a "Roles" table listing the parts it accepts.
   Read it as a checklist and ask, for every control you are proposing: does this
   component have an element for each part, and if not, why not?

   | Control | Parts it accepts |
   |---|---|
   | `textbox` family | `label`, `description`, `errormessage`, `value`, `placeholder` |
   | `checkbox`, `radio`, `switch` | `label`, `description`, `errormessage`, `indicator` |
   | `group` | `label`, `description`, `errormessage` |
   | `disclosure` | `label`, `panel`, `indicator` |
   | `button`, `togglebutton`, `link` | `label`, `description`, `indicator` |
   | `spinbutton` | `label`, `description`, `value`, `increment`, `decrement` |

   An absence resolves one of two ways, and they want different outcomes:

   - **The element exists and you did not propose for it.** A defect in the
     proposal. Add the row.
   - **The design has no such element.** A finding about the library, reported and
     never proposed — there is nothing to annotate. State which components are
     affected and what the consequence is.

   The second is the one worth the pass. On a real 69-component library every
   field had a label and a description and **no component drew an error message at
   all**, so `errormessage` — fully implemented — went unproposed and unmentioned.
   Ten components could say what a value is for and none could say what was wrong
   with it. No per-element reading surfaces that; only asking what a control
   usually comes with does.

   Check the inverse too: a part with no control anywhere in its component is
   valid — that is a provider declaring what it offers — but a part whose control
   is a *deferred-vocabulary instance* will emit an id pointing at nothing. Report
   those rather than proposing them.

7. **Write the report, in this order.** The shape matters: a reviewer reads the
   decisions first and the exceptions after.

   **Intro.** Three sentences on what a role is and why it cannot be derived, then
   one sentence carrying every number — components, elements, roles proposed, roles
   that do not exist, Figma changes needed, components needing none — then the
   decision rule. No separate summary table; it duplicates the intro. Follow it
   with an anchor list of the sections.

   **Proposed roles.** One flat table for the whole library, not per-component
   tables. Reviewers do group by component, but the flat shape is what makes a
   library-wide inconsistency visible — eight `label` rows side by side is how a
   missing ninth gets noticed.

   | Column | Content |
   |---|---|
   | `✓` | `[x]` to apply, `[ ]` to skip. Default every row to `[x]` |
   | Component | spec key |
   | Element | anatomy key |
   | Role | the concept, linked to its page on specsplugin.com |
   | Rationale | the evidence, prefixed by a marker where one applies |

   Append `(Not yet supported)` to a role that emits nothing, and keep its link —
   a link is to documentation, not a claim that the concept works. **Take support
   from the Inventory's status, never from whether a page exists**: `group`,
   `radio` and `textarea` have complete pages and emit nothing. Only
   **Implemented** emits; **Specified** and a bare dash do not. Reading the link as
   the signal mislabels six rows on a library of this size, and the error only
   surfaces when someone runs the transform and finds a `<div>` where they
   expected a `<fieldset>`.

   `[x]` / `[ ]` rather than a checkmark-or-blank, so clearing a row is a
   positive act. Blank cannot distinguish "rejected" from "never read", and both
   would stop the sweep.

   No confidence column: on a real library it is one value for ninety per cent of
   rows, which is a column of noise that also hides the few rows worth arguing
   about. Put `⚠️ Lower confidence` at the front of those rows' Rationale
   instead.

   Prefix a row with `✏️ Figma change, see below` when it depends on an asset
   change. Propose the role on the element that **will** exist, so the table is the
   whole picture rather than the applicable part of it.

   Rationale carries **checkable evidence only** — `an open prop and a panel
   beside it`, `Field.Label, a text sibling of the control`. Never provenance:
   a rationale reading "library convention" on eleven rows tells a reviewer nothing
   they can verify, and it is really a pointer to a sentence below the table. Put
   that sentence below the table and let each row stand on its own evidence.

   **Figma asset changes**, below the proposal table. An element carries at most
   one role, so a component needing two semantics across its variants has to say so
   with two elements — a banner that interrupts as a danger and confirms as a
   success cannot do both on one. Show it as before and after layout trees, each
   node `<layer name> (<type>) ## comment where needed`, indented. Keep the prose
   to a few sentences; the trees carry the explanation.

   **Proposed new roles**, below that. Only concepts that are **not in the
   vocabulary at all** — a concept that exists but emits nothing is real vocabulary
   and belongs in the proposal table marked `(Not yet supported)`. Columns:
   `#`, Role, Apply to, Rationale (one or two sentences), Existing alternatives.
   Then any gaps that are not new roles as short bullets: a missing resolution
   rule, a concept with no page, concepts deferred by design.

   **Always propose the concept the element actually is**, even when nothing emits
   for it, and name the working alternative in the Existing alternatives column. A
   spec recording what an element is stays true as support arrives; one recording a
   near-miss has to be re-annotated, and nobody will remember which rows were
   compromises.

8. **Say where no role belongs.** Most elements take none, and that is a correct
   outcome rather than a gap. A table of component names grouped by reason:
   deferred concepts, concepts that do not exist, layout-only, blocked on something
   else. Then the elements inside *annotated* components left bare on purpose —
   those are the ones a reviewer will otherwise ask about. Three recurring traps:

   - A part cannot resolve to a control in **another** component — parts resolve by
     component. A trigger component and a panel component used together cannot
     pair, so do not propose the part; record the gap.
   - An `aria-label` text layer is not a `label`. That part emits a visible
     `<label>`; an accessible name with no visible text reaches the output as a
     contract prop.
   - A control's own text is its content, not a `label`. Proposing `label` on a
     button's or disclosure's text points a `<label>` at a button.

9. **Reconcile, then validate.** Every component must appear exactly once across
   the proposal table and the no-role list — compute it rather than trusting the
   prose, because a component addressed in neither is invisible, and that is how
   two whole components get missed. Then check every row: the element key exists in
   that component's anatomy, and the role is in the vocabulary. A row naming an
   element that is not there fails at write time, mid-sweep.

10. **GATE — human review.** Hand over the path and stop. The reviewer clears the
   `[x]` on anything they reject. If they question a proposal, settle it to apply
   or skip in conversation and edit the row — the report never carries a third
   answer, because the applier would have to interpret one.
