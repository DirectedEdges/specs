# Pre-merge report

Compare the specs a Figma feature branch produces against the specs main
produces, and put the graded impact report in front of a human before the
merge.

All content is scripted. This skill only sequences commands and stops at the
gates — it never writes or edits report content, never summarizes the diff in
its own words, and never decides whether the merge proceeds.

## Steps

1. **Run the pipeline** from the workspace (it needs `config/` and a
   `FIGMA_TOKEN` in the workspace `.env`), passing the Figma branch URL:

   ```bash
   specs version figmapremerge "<figma branch URL>"
   ```

   The command fetches both sides in parallel, generates both spec trees,
   diffs them, and writes the run under `versions/diffs/<date>-<branch>/` —
   the report is `report.md` in that folder, and it also prints to stdout.
   By default only the report and the impacted components' specs are kept;
   pass `--keep-data` to retain both full spec trees and the fetched
   payloads.

2. **GATE — human reads the report.** Hand over the report path and stop.
   Do not summarize it, grade it, or soften it. The reader decides whether the
   merge proceeds.

3. Only after an explicit go-ahead does the merge continue, outside this skill.
