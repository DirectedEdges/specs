# Set up icon glyphs

Establish the
[`glyphs` convention](https://www.specsplugin.com/settings/glyphs/) in
`config/conventions/figma.yaml`: how this library marks a component as an icon glyph,
so a placed icon resolves to a **name** rather than an anonymous vector.

With no `glyphs` block, glyph detection does not run at all. An icon layer is typed as
an ordinary element, and the spec records its geometry but not which icon it is. With the
block, the layer is typed `glyph` and the icon's name lands in the element's `content`.

This skill **authors a convention**, like `states.setup` and `roles.propose`. The shape
of the evidence — a name pattern, a child structure — is mechanical and checkable. What is
not mechanical is **which components in a file are icons at all.** An icon file usually
also holds illustrations, logos, UI chrome, and parts other components instance. No rule
separates those from the icon set; that is the judgment, and getting it wrong is how a
convention claims 400 components that are not icons.

## Order matters, and it costs a refetch

The `icons` fetch kind **cannot run before this convention exists** — `specs fetch`
refuses to start without it. So the sequence is:

1. the icons file is already fetched with `fetch: [file]`, and scanned
2. this skill establishes the convention from that payload
3. `icons` is added to the source's fetch list
4. **that source is refetched**, which is when icons are actually pulled

Say the refetch is coming before you start. On a large icon file it is the slowest step in
the whole setup, and a user who is not expecting it will think something looped.

## Steps

1. **Know which artifact answers which question.** This is the whole discipline of this
   skill, and getting it wrong is the one failure that reliably produces a confident
   wrong answer:

   | Artifact | States | Does **not** state |
   |---|---|---|
   | `data/<alias>.manifest.md` | component name, node id, node type, dev status | **parentage, children, size, properties** |
   | `data/<alias>.file/page-*.json` | `type`, `children`, `componentPropertyDefinitions`, `absoluteBoundingBox` — explicitly | — |
   | an emitted `api.yaml` | the anatomy of a component that was generated | anything about a component that was not |

   **A `/` in a layer name is not containment.** `Icon / <Search>` tells you nothing
   about whether that component sits inside a set — Figma names are free text and the
   slash is a convention. The payload states the parent. Read it.

   So: **names suggest, structure decides, and the regenerate proves.** Never report a
   structural fact that came from the manifest.

   The source must already be fetched and scanned:

   ```bash
   specs scan --source <alias>
   ```

   If the manifest does not exist, stop — there is no candidate list to start from.

2. **Get candidates from the names. Suggestion only.** Search the manifest for components
   whose names contain `icon`, case-insensitively, and look at the shape of what comes
   back:

   - **Are there many?** An icon set is dozens to hundreds. Five components named
     "icon-something" are probably parts of other components.
   - **Are they all named the same way, in a pattern?** A fixed frame with the icon's own
     name varying inside it.
   - **Is there more than one such pattern?** Two prefixes with the same internal shape
     are two candidate populations, not one with exceptions. Keep them separate from here
     on and prove each one independently.

   Record the counts. Nothing about membership is settled yet.

   If nothing with `icon` in the name comes back in quantity, go to step 4.

3. **Prove each candidate population structurally, from the payload.** Sample several
   components from the population — not one — and read their actual nodes in
   `data/<alias>.file/page-*.json`. Two requirements must hold, and they are the test:

   | Must hold | Why | Where it is stated |
   |---|---|---|
   | The component is a `COMPONENT` whose parent is **not** a `COMPONENT_SET`, and it declares no component properties | A glyph is a static asset; a configurable component is not a glyph | the node's `type`, its parent's `type`, and `componentPropertyDefinitions` |
   | It contains at least one `VECTOR`, or a group of nodes that would export cleanly as an SVG | This is what makes it a glyph rather than a small composed component | the node's `children` |

   Then gather corroborating evidence. **None of it is conclusive on its own**, and all of
   it is worth stating because a reviewer can sanity-check it instantly:

   - Are they all the same size?
   - Are they all square?
   - Are they all small — 16×16, 24×24, that order of magnitude?
   - Is the structure shallow, rather than a deep tree of frames?

   **Then look for the disproof.** Deliberately sample for components in the population
   that do *not* share the uniformity — a different size, a deeper structure, properties,
   a set parent. Report what you find. A population with a handful of outliers is still an
   icon set with outliers worth naming; a population where the outliers are half of it was
   never one population, and the name pattern is doing the wrong work.

   When naming, structure and uniformity all align, the name form is justified — go to
   step 5. When the structure test fails, the population is not glyphs however it is named,
   and saying so is the correct outcome.

4. **When no name pattern exists, let structure find the population.** Some libraries name
   glyphs plainly as the icon itself — `Cross`, `Chevron down` — with nothing in the
   name marking them as icons at all. There, the population has to be found rather than
   filtered:

   - **Look for a large list of components concentrated on one page, or a few pages.** An
     icon set is almost always authored together. Page locality is the strongest signal
     available when names carry nothing.
   - **Within that list, look for the uniform shallow vector structure** from step 3 —
     same size, square, small, one or a few vectors, no properties, not in a set.
   - **Check whether the names are *just* the icon name.** If so, `structure.name`
     defaults to `'{i}'` and the whole component name becomes the glyph name.

   Then run step 3's proof and disproof against that population exactly as if a name had
   suggested it. The order of discovery changes; the standard of evidence does not.

5. **Confirm the populations with the user — once, after the proof.** Ask about
   *membership*, never about syntax. Which components are icons is the one thing they know
   and you cannot derive; the pattern and the structure matcher are derivable and asking
   about them is friction.

   Show them, per candidate population: the count, two or three example names, the
   structural facts that held, the uniformity, and any outliers. Then one question:

   > "I found two groups that look like icon sets: 364 components under `Icon /` and 38
   > under `Icon object /`. Both are standalone components, each a single vector, all
   > 24×24. Are both icon sets, or is one of them something else?"

   Their answer decides membership. Do not relitigate it with evidence afterwards — if
   they say a population is not icons, it is not icons.

6. **Write the name form.** It is one line, it is self-documenting, and it needs no
   payload read:

   ```yaml
   glyphs:
     match: 'DS Icon Glyph / {i}'
   ```

   `{i}` marks where the icon's name appears and becomes a `(.+)` capture — the
   captured text is the glyph name. The pattern must contain it, and it matches the
   component name whole.

   **`glyphs.match` is one string, not a list.** `subcomponents.match` and
   `instanceExamples.match` in the same file are lists, so the sequence form is the
   natural guess — and it is rejected with an error saying no glyphs convention is
   declared at all, which points nowhere near the real cause. If you need to cover two
   name patterns, see step 8.

   Prefer a pattern that is anchored by punctuation the icons carry and the other
   populations do not. A delimiter the set uses consistently does the excluding for free,
   where a bare prefix leaves `{i}` to swallow whatever follows it.

7. **Measure the pattern both ways.** A pattern is only right if it is both
   complete and clean, and the manifest is enough to check both without fetching anything:

   - **Recall** — of the components you called icons in step 2, how many does it match?
   - **Precision** — does it match anything you called *not* an icon?

   Report both as counts. A pattern that matches 612 of 639 is not a pass; name the 27 and
   say what they are. Usually they are a second naming generation, a deprecated set, or
   proof that step 2's grouping was wrong.

   **Do not widen a pattern to swallow misses.** `{i}` is greedy, so a loose pattern
   silently claims whole populations, and each wrongly-claimed component gets a glyph name
   that is not an icon name. A tight pattern with named exceptions beats a loose one.

8. **Write the structural form**, for the population step 4 found. Membership comes from
   what the component contains rather than what it is called:

   ```yaml
   glyphs:
     structure:
       children:
         - type: VECTOR
           name: 'Vector'
   ```

   Write the matcher from the nodes you already read in step 3 — do not re-derive it from
   one component, and do not widen it to cover an outlier step 3 told you about. The
   matcher has to hold for the whole population or the population was wrong.

   Four semantics to get right, because each one is easy to read the other way:

   - **`children` is a set of alternatives, not a positional list.**
     `children: [{type: VECTOR}]` means *every child is a VECTOR*, any number of them —
     not "exactly one child". A matcher never has to be used, but every child must be
     covered by some matcher.
   - **Coverage is exhaustive.** A component holding anything the matchers do not cover is
     not a glyph. This is the protection against over-claiming, and it is why a matcher
     that lists every node type you saw is worse than one that lists the types a glyph
     actually has.
   - **`name` on a matcher is literal, with `*` as the only wildcard**, matched whole
     against the whitespace-normalised node name. Add it only where the name is genuinely
     consistent; a matcher that is right about type and wrong about name silently matches
     nothing.
   - **`fill` tests leaves only** — the childless nodes the matchers matched — and every
     one of them must carry a visible solid fill in the accepted list. It is skipped on
     placed instances, which context recolours, so it constrains the stored component
     only. Declare it only if the set is genuinely monochrome and you have checked more
     than one component; it is the member most likely to narrow the match to nothing.

9. **Set `structure.name` when the component name is not the icon name.** It defaults to
   `'{i}'`, meaning the whole component name is the glyph name. Declare it when the names
   carry an affix the icon name should not keep — `name: '{i}Icon'` captures
   `Close` from `CloseIcon`.

10. **Re-check the disqualifiers against what you are about to declare.** Three kinds of component can never
   be a structural glyph, whatever their children look like:

   - a **component set**
   - a **variant** inside a component set
   - any component **declaring component properties** — variants, text props, instance
     swaps

   A glyph has no properties by definition: a component that can be configured is a
   configurable component. If the set you identified in step 2 is property-bearing, the
   structural form cannot claim it and the name form is your only option — say so rather
   than building a matcher that will match nothing.

11. **Two populations, and only one `match`.** A file often holds two patterned sets —
   `Icon / <{i}>` and `Icon object / <{i}>`, or a current generation beside a legacy
   one. `match` holds one pattern, so they cannot both be named that way.

   What is available:

   - **Both forms together.** `match` and `structure` may both be declared, and a
     component matching *either* is a glyph. If the second population shares a child
     structure the first one's non-icons do not, `structure` can cover it.
   - **Pick the larger population and report the rest.** Name every component in the
     uncovered set, say what it is, and say plainly that it stays undetected. A user who
     knows 38 icons are missing can decide what to do; a user told "icons are set up" cannot.

   **Do not widen `match` to span both.** A pattern loose enough to catch two
   populations catches whatever sits between them, and `{i}` is greedy. Two sets with one
   covered correctly beats both covered wrongly.

   If this is the case you are in, say so in the report as a limitation of the convention
   rather than a judgment you made — it is the config shape, not the library.

12. **Write the block and report.** Into `config/conventions/figma.yaml`, with the counts
   and the reasoning:

   - the grouping from step 2, as counts
   - the form chosen, and why the other was rejected — for a structural match, the sampled
     components it was derived from
   - recall and precision, as numbers
   - every component you called an icon that the convention does **not** match, named
   - anything it matches that you did not call an icon, named — this list should be empty,
     and if it is not, say why you are accepting it

13. **Turn icons on and refetch that source.** The convention does nothing for the payload
    until the fetch kind is added:

    ```yaml
    sources:
      <alias>:
        fetch: [file, icons]
    ```

    ```bash
    specs fetch --only <alias>,icons
    ```

    `--only` takes aliases and fetch kinds, so naming both narrows the run to one
    source's glyphs. **Not `--source`** — that flag is for a file that is not in the
    config and takes a URL or key, not an alias.

    **The count it reports is the first real proof.** It should match the population size
    you proved in step 3, give or take the outliers you named. A number far below it means
    the convention is narrower than the population; far above means it is claiming
    components you never examined. Either way, say the two numbers side by side rather
    than reporting that the fetch succeeded.

14. **Regenerate, and confirm the names landed — this is what makes the claim true.** A
    convention that matches nothing fails exactly like one that was never written: no
    error, no warning, and specs that look complete.

    ```bash
    specs generate
    ```

    In a spec that places an icon, the element must be `type: glyph` **and** carry a
    `content` naming the icon. Check both. `type: glyph` with no `content` means the
    component matched but the name capture produced nothing — a `{i}` in the wrong place,
    or a `structure.name` that does not fit.

    Report the three numbers together: the population you proved, the glyphs the fetch
    resolved, and the elements now typed `glyph` with a name. Nothing before this step
    establishes that the convention works; everything before it establishes only that it
    was plausible.

    If nothing is a glyph at all, the convention matched nothing. Do not widen it blindly:
    take one component you proved in step 3, compare it against the convention member by
    member, and report which member excluded it. For a structural match the usual culprits
    are `fill` and a matcher `name`, in that order.
