/**
 * The Dev Mode status render writes back into Figma, read from the scan manifest.
 *
 * `specs scan` already records each component's status in the manifest's Dev Status
 * column, so render does not need to ask Figma for it — the curation file the workspace
 * already keeps is the record. This resolves that file once per run and indexes it by
 * Figma node id, which is what a spec carries at `metadata.source.nodeId`.
 *
 * Only `READY_FOR_DEV` and `COMPLETED` are indexed. `NONE`, an unknown status, a
 * component with no row, and a workspace with no manifest all mean the same thing here:
 * render is given nothing to write, and leaves the node's status alone. Asserting a
 * status the scan never recorded would make a render claim something about the component
 * that no one stated.
