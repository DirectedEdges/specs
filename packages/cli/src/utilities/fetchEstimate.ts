/**
 * How long a fetch will wait before Figma sends anything.
 *
 * A file payload is built on demand: Figma serializes the whole document before
 * the first byte leaves, and only repeats that work when the file changed since
 * the last fetch. For a large file the build dominates — measured at roughly 10
 * to 18 seconds per 100MB, against a transfer that runs at about 75MB/s — so the
 * wait, not the download, is what a caller sits through. Reporting the two as one
 * number is why a 700MB fetch looks like a hang.
 *
 * The size of the last fetch of the same source predicts the wait better than
 * anything else available, and it is already on disk. None of this is precise
 * enough to quote a figure, so callers get a band and never a number.
