 * source convention — under the `NONE` default nothing diverges and this report is
 * empty, which is correct: no convention was declared, so no name departed from one.
 *
 * A recorded name is NOT by itself a naming problem. The field has two independent
 * triggers: format divergence (ADR-066) and wrapper-collapse provenance (ADR-058), and
 * the latter fires on the `root` key regardless of `figmaKeys` or of how well-formed
 * the name is. `Text` on a collapsed root is perfectly safe under SENTENCE and
 * round-trips unaided. So each recorded name is re-tested against the safe key grammar
 * here, and only genuine failures are reported.
